        Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the
        web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end
        to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development
        challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live
        on the web, mobile, or the desktop
    </p>

    <h3>Architecture overview</h3>

    <p>
        Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in
        HTML and TypeScript. Angular is itself written in TypeScript. It
        implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript
        libraries that you import into your apps.
    </p>

    <p>
        The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which
        provide a compilation context for components. NgModules collect related
        code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of
        NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that enables
        bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
    </p>

    <p>
        Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular
        can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data.
        Every app has at least a root component.
    </p>

    <p>
        Components use services, which provide specific functionality not
        directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into
        components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and
        efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that
        mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.
    </p>

    <p>
        The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that
        defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular
        directives and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML
        before rendering it for display.
    </p>

    <p>
        The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs
        to make it available to components through Dependency Injection (DI).
    </p>

    <p>
        An app's components typically define many views, arranged
        hierarchically. Angular provides the Router service to help you define
        navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated
        in-browser navigational capabilities.
